Specify: Each group creates a class called Jumper. This actor can move forward two cells in each move. It “jumps” over rocks and flowers. 
It does not leave anything behind it when it jumps. In the small groups, discuss and clarify the details of the problem: 

What will a jumper do if the location in front of it is empty, but the location two cells in front contains a flower or a rock? 
It will not jump and then turn 90 degrees to the right


What will a jumper do if the location two cells in front of the jumper is out of the grid?
It will not jump and then turn 90 degrees to the right


What will a jumper do if it is facing an edge of the grid?
It turns 90 degrees to the right


What will a jumper do if another actor (not a flower or a rock) is in the cell that is two cells in front of the jumper?
It could turn around 45 degrees clockwise


What will a jumper do if it encounters another jumper in its path?
It would turn 45 degrees clockwise and continue in its path


What if the jumper is surrounded by rocks that are one block away from it.
It will turn 90 degrees 4 times, and turn 45 degrees after
